# Flask Datastore Host

This is a flask based Google DataStore Host. This is very nearly the same code that runs www.glowscript.org at the moment.

The idea is to first get this working with the old auth/Datastore modules but configuring different guest runners.

Then we'll factor out editing/storage to be more modular.
