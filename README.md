# Flask Host

This is a flask based host that can use Google DataStore or MongoDB to store user programs and folders. 

This is very nearly the same code that runs www.glowscript.org except it uses a translation layer between the application and the database.

The idea is to get this working with the old Google auth and Google Datastore or MongoDB but configuring different guest runners based on the progam source.
